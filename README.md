# Data-Structure-Algorithms
This folder contains code files implementing the following algorithms and data structures:

# **Huffman Algorithm:**

This algorithm is used for data compression and decompression.
The code file provides an implementation of the Huffman encoding and decoding process.

# **Infix to Postfix Conversion:**

This algorithm converts infix expressions to postfix notation.
The code file includes a function that takes an infix expression as input and returns its equivalent postfix expression.

# **Linked List:**

This data structure represents a collection of nodes linked together, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
The code file provides an implementation of a linked list with operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

# **Tree:**

This data structure represents a hierarchical structure of nodes, where each node can have zero or more child nodes.
The code file includes an implementation of a tree data structure, along with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

# **Heapsort:**

Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses the heap data structure.
The code file includes an implementation of the heapsort algorithm for sorting an array of elements.

# **Permutations:**

The code file contains a function that generates distinct sorted permutations of a given string.
It uses a recursive approach to generate all possible permutations, ensuring that each permutation is distinct and sorted.
Note: The code files may have additional functions, utility functions, or auxiliary code to support the main implementation. Each code file can be independently compiled and executed to observe the respective algorithm or data structure in action.
